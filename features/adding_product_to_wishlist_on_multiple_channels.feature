    And the store also operates on another channel named "Web-EU" in "EUR" currency
    And the store has a product "Leprechaun's Gold" priced at "$100.00" available in channel "Web-US" and channel "Web-EU"
    And the store has a product "Leprechaun's Silver" priced at "â‚¬10.00" in "Web-EU" channel
    And all store products appear under a main taxonomy
